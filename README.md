# icmpy
This package provides a python interface to [molsoft's icm](https://www.molsoft.com/) cheminformatics software.

## install and setup

This package requires that users have a working installation of [molsoft icm](https://www.molsoft.com/)
and have a valid license. First export the license such that it is available in the working environment:

```bash 
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=/path/to/molsoft/license.dat
```

```bash 
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=/path/to/molsoft/license.dat
```

confirm that molsoft is working:

```bash
/path/to/molsoft/executable/icm
```
The last line should print out "...ICM startup file executed..."


Then install the python package using pip from this github repo:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/philippguevorguian/icmpy
```

## usage
A script `generate_molsoft_conformers.py` and configuration file `config.yaml` which generates rdkit mol objects with multiple conformers and their energies is available in the `scripts` directory. 
To run this script:

```bash
python generate_molsoft_conformers.py --icm_path /path/to/molsoft/executable/icm
```

The script should print out the first input's RMSD matrix (pairwise RMSD values between generated conformers) and energies of each conformation generated by the icm softwre. Note that in the script only SMILES are used, but paths to SDF files are also valid.
